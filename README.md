Wal-Mart API Demo

Using the Wal-Mart API. This project was created to get some experience playing with jQuery and JSON objects and APIs then displaying them in HTML and dynamically updating the elements in the page. 

Things to keep in mind:

1. Search results show first three items returned
2. For simplicity sake, after entering an item, either:
   a. Leave the Minimum Price and Maximum Price fields blank 
   b. OR fill in the Minimum Price AND the Maximum Price

   The logic is not set up yet to keep you from entering only a minimum price or a maximum price only.
